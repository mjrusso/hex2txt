# hex2txt

Convert documentation for [hex.pm packages](https://hex.pm) to [`/llms.txt`
files](https://llmstxt.org).

## Why?

The LLM you're using to help with development might not know about the
libraries you're using. Use `hex2txt` to generate documentation for
inference-time consumption.

## Demo/Example
